            "1. Inclusivity and representation: The system should ensure that all eligible citizens have an equal opportunity to participate and that diverse groups are adequately represented.\n",

            "3. Stability and legitimacy: The system should produce stable and legitimate governments that can effectively govern and implement policies.\n",

MMP combines elements of proportional representation (PR) and single-member district representation. A portion of the legislature is elected through party-list PR, ensuring that the distribution of seats closely matches the overall popular vote. The remaining seats are elected through single-member districts, providing local representation.\n",
            "\n",
            "This system can strike a balance between representing diverse political viewpoints proportionally while also maintaining a connection between voters and local representatives. It can promote inclusive governance, accountability, and stability by ensuring that no single party dominates and that coalitions are often required to govern effectively.\n",

            "For instance, MMP systems can sometimes lead to a proliferation of smaller parties in the legislature, making it difficult to form stable governing coalitions. There is also a risk of creating two \"classes\" of legislators, with some elected directly and others through party lists, which could lead to tensions or imbalances in representation.\n",
            "\n",
            "Additionally, while the MMP system aims to provide proportional representation, the specific implementation and electoral thresholds can still create distortions or biases in favor of larger parties.

            "While MMP can promote inclusive representation and accountable governance, there are risks of fragmentation and instability if the system leads to a large number of small parties in the legislature. Measures such as reasonable vote thresholds or incentives for pre-election coalitions may be needed to mitigate this risk.\n",
            "\n",
            "The potential for creating a perceived \"class\" divide between directly elected and list representatives is also a valid concern. Clear rules and transparency around the selection of list candidates, as well as efforts to ensure equal status and roles for all legislators, could help address this issue.\n",
